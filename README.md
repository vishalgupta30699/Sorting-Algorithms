Sorting Techniques 

Quick Sort :- QuickSort is an algorithm based on divide and conquer technique in which an array is split into two subarrays and these subarrays are recursively called to sort the elements.Partition point is called pivot.In left side of array value is less than pivot and in right side of array value is greater than pivot.

  Time Complexity :- O(nlogn)



Bubble Sort :- Bubble Sort is an algorithm that compares the adjacent elements and swap their positions if they are not in the intended order.
The order can be ascending or descending.

Steps:-

Starting from the first index, compare the first element with the second element if the first element is greater than the swap element and then compare the second element with third element and the process goes on until the last element.


  Time Complexity :- O(n^2)



Selection Sort:- Selection Sort is an algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.


  Time Complexity:- O(n^2)


Insertion Sort:- Insertion Sort is an algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.

	Time Complexity:- O(n^2)
  
Merge Sort :- Merge Sort is a kind of Divide and Conquer algorithm .It is one of the most popular sorting algorithms and a great way to develop confidence in building recursive algorithms.

  Time Complexity :- O(nlog n)

Radix Sort :- Radix Sort is a sorting technique that sorts the elements by first grouping  the individual  digits of the same place value.Then ,sort the element according to their inc/dec order.

	Time Complexity -O(nlog n)

Heap Sort :- Heap Sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end.We repeat the same process for the remaining element.

	Time Complexity :- O(nlog n)

Linear Sort :- Linear sort is a sorting technique in which the first element is compared to the second,if the first element is larger than swap it then the first element is compared to third and this process goes on until the end.

	Time Complexity :- O(nlog n)
